# Vilor-Event-Booking-System
Design a simple event booking system
- Display a list of events with the cover image, title, description and date.
- Enable user registration if the event still has more than zero remaining slots.
- Prevent user registration if the event has zero remaining slots and prompt the user accordingly.
- Prohibit event registration if the phone number does not start with “+60” or “60”.
- Display a success message to the user upon successful registration.-
